            This page should focus on your brand's background. What's your unique story? Why<br>
should prospective clients choose to sign up with you? This is your chance to build a<br>
relationship with them, starting with your backstory, vision, or philosophy. You can even<br>
share your brand's beginnings if you feel that it's relatable to your clients. Just remember to<br>
be friendly, and welcoming.
<br><br>Once you're done, seal the deal with a compelling closing line that gets them to take action.
